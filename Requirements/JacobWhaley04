Wolves Den (Inspired by Pac-Man)

The player is a hunter looking for treasure in a cave but must avoid wolves in order to obtain it. 
It is inspired by Pac Man where the cave is the same each level but the ammo, 
treasure are less or more and in random spots. 

Requirements:

1. The game shall use a fixed cave map that remains the same layout for every level.

2. The player shall control a hunter character using keyboard input (e.g., arrow keys or WASD).

3. The cave shall contain wolves that move autonomously and act as enemies to the player.

4. The player shall lose a life if the hunter collides with a wolf while not protected or armed.

5. The game shall randomly place treasure items in different locations at the start of each level.

6. The game shall randomly place ammo pickups in the cave at the start of each level.

7. The number of treasure items shall vary per level, increasing or decreasing based on difficulty.

8. The player shall collect treasure by moving over it, increasing the player’s score.

9. The player shall be able to pick up ammo, which allows the hunter to temporarily defend against wolves.

10. When the player has ammo, they shall be able to defeat wolves, removing them from the cave for a limited time.
